///    fingerprint equals an earlier rule's can never win against its first
///    occurrence (see `dedup_fingerprint`).
/// 3. **Constant folding & constant-false pruning** — logic trees simplify
///    (never-match children erase OR arms and kill AND trees, double
///    negation cancels, single-child trees collapse); rules that provably
///    never match (a rule reporting [`Rule::never_matches`], a `UID` rule on
///    a platform without socket-UID lookup, or a logic tree folding to
///    false) are dropped from the scan plan, and a tree folding to true
///    becomes an unconditional `MATCH` terminator.

///    set is fully covered by earlier DOMAIN-SUFFIX / DOMAIN-KEYWORD /
///    star-wildcard rules, or a later IP-CIDR contained in the union of
///    earlier same-axis networks, can never fire, so it is dropped
