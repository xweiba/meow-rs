//! Outbound-interface binding for global route scope (#375, issue #695).
//!
//! `auto-route: global` steers all traffic into the TUN, so every socket
//! meow opens must be bound to the physical interface (via
//! `meow_common::install_outbound_interface`: `SO_BINDTODEVICE` on Linux,
//! `IP_BOUND_IF` on macOS, `IP_UNICAST_IF` on Windows) or it loops back
//! into the device.
//! The binding is per-socket and applied at creation: a socket created
//! before it is installed stays unbound for its whole life, and once the
//! split default routes go in its traffic re-enters the TUN — a QUIC or mux
//! session opened by an early startup dial (geodata download, provider
//! fetch, health probe) then loops until it times out.
//!
//! [`OutboundBinding`] owns one installation of that process-global
//! binding. The binary installs it *before* the config build performs its
//! first dial, and a config reload installs the new configuration's
//! binding before the reload's first dial (both via
//! `meow_api::preinstall_global_route_binding`); either hands it to
//! [`TunListener::with_outbound_binding`]. A listener started without one
//! (the pre-install failed) installs its own before touching routes.
//! Either way the listener's device owns it, so it is given up exactly
//! when the routes it protects go away — listener teardown, reload, or a
//! startup failure.
//!
//! Owners may overlap — a reload's binding is installed while the old
//! listener still runs. The registry is owner-aware
//! (`meow_common::OutboundIfaceGuard`): the newest live owner is in
//! effect, dropping it restores the newest owner still alive, and dropping
//! a superseded owner is a no-op. So a rejected reload restores the
//! running listener's binding, and an old listener torn down after its
//! successor installed never clears the successor's binding.
//!
//! [`TunListener::with_outbound_binding`]: super::TunListener::with_outbound_binding
